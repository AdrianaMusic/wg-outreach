On 1/9/2020 we had our second meeting to go over the results of the survey and talk about what we wanted to do moving forward. We focused mostly on the fact that the majority of respondents (51.3%) wanted help learning how to contribute to open source projects. This seems like a big opportunity both to help .NET coders and projects that are in the foundation. Our next meeting will be to discuss the details around a possible event, timing, logistics, and goals. Notes are below. Will be posting details for the next meeting in this repo. Thanks, all who were able to attend.

NOTES
(Jeremy) In regards to helping people contribute to open source, I really love the idea of having some sort of bash. Having people show examples where new folks can contribute. I picked on to contribute, It would actually be helpful for me, I’ve done a little bit of contributions via pull requests and would love to do more.

Usually when I’m looking into an issue, I’m looking into the source code. I use tools like IL Spy, DN Spy, when I find something out of the ordinary. I found somewhere in an open source library.

(Duracellko) I see two points of view, sometimes it’s really hard to understand where to start. It is difficult to me to find issues to start on. There are places to look, but I’m not sure about where to start. I think it’s hard to understand where to start. I don’t spend much time contributing. When I have a few days free, or have some free time, I find it hard to know where to start. It’s hard to find or learn and estimate how to get started. When you want to interest a lot of people, I know some companies do their own hackathons, I find contributing to open source more valuable. Sometime it doesn’t really finish. They plan the application with the goal that we may not finish this in one day. I find that with a contribution I can do a small feature and it will be used and not thrown away. I think in this we can emphasize ways to do this in the community.

(Pratik) When I started looking into the CoreFX library, my experience was complex to figure out. It was difficult to get started. For the .NET foundation project we can do videos so people can start easily. We have a good way to label issues for beginners, but a lot of time people still find it difficult. People find they don’t know how to contribute. We can label open source projects for people to get started with their first PRs. I myself have an open source project on Github which is a Nuget package. I don’t always have time or resources to make it work. I was working on an app to simplify experiences in IoT, it’s easy to find people that want to contribute to web but not others.

(Duracellko) I agree with Pratik that sometimes libraries are too big, sometimes roadmaps are out of date and that makes it harder for people to contribute. Hacktoberfest is a good time to do this (in October). Library owners identify low hanging fruit.

(Steve Gordon) I was going to mention hacktoberfest, people find it inspirational and motivating to get involved. It would allow people to get through the hurdles. Since it’s annual sometimes things fall off, so maybe a checkin there would be good.

(Sara) Does someone own Hacktoberfest?

(Pratik) Digital Ocean and Github. If you know about Google Summer of Code, it’s super popular. There is Google Summer of Code and that’s a great way to get people involved and participate.

(Jeremy) I work in an enterprise environment. There should be a way to provide developers that don’t contribute to open source to help them get involved. I’m the only one on my team that actively goes out and looks for places to get involved. That would be beneficial for people that want to grow but it would be something we can do as part of a 8-5.

(Duracellko) We see other code bases, not just the codebases of our projects which is great for personal development.

(Jeremy) A few months ago I started working with a coworker, and I’ve done some things with Kubernetes. I took it on myself to use the YAML pipeline instead of the open source pipeline. I see a lot of the advantage of learning from people that have done things in open source. There are so many people that are trying to do things in open source that can learn from each other.

(Sara) As a next step I’m going to talk to Beth (Microsoft) and some folks at Stack Overflow. I’d like to ask this group if there are any issues with looping in the other foundations. What do you think.

(Jeremy) I think it would be good to show the cross-platform capabilities.

(Steve Gordon) I think expounding on the idea that we like open source events over internal hackathons, I think it would be great to get a doc together to circulate a doc within companies.

(Jeremy) You said something that put off a lightbulb on my head, you said youtube. What if we did something monthly, or bi-monthly, we have people get on camera and present something they are working on. A mini presentation Like a global user group. I know for me, public speaking is hard. I feel like that is a way to get people together.

(Gurucharan) Most projects has a “how to build this” but not a “how this thing works”. Possibly an owner can do a video on how to get started or how to start contributing. They can put it in their README.

(Steve Gordon) My first interaction with Open Source was the humanitarian toolbox. Something we found super successful for us was a fortnightly standup on YouTube. It let people who wasn’t part or the project they can talk on it. We found it quite useful for onboarding people on their first project.

(Jeremy) I remember that project, it was probably the first thing I contributed to. I remember it was one of the first issues I knocked out.

(Steve Gordon) Once we did a meetup for the Humanitarian Toolbox and 12 people knocked out about 100 pull requests in 24 hours. It was great, there was a lot of small beginner issues. People could make code changes that were a few lines, it was great.

We ran a pre-hackday session for getting people setup, for the most part we had a lot of people turn up ready to go at 9a. So we didn’t lose time.

(Sara) Okay, with these details let's circle back at our next meeting. I'd like to talk to possible partners in the meantime.
